*XXX This guide is under construction....*

This guide discusses how Pyramid differs from Pylons, and how to make it more
like Pylons. It may indirectly help those familiar with Django or other
Rails-like frameworks too. It complements the Pyramid manual by explaining
things in a different way, highlighting aspects pertinent to Pylons-like
applications, and covering some things not in the manual.

See also Akhet_, a third-party library that adds some
Pylons-like features. It includes a demo application that shows them in action,
and also contains some templates, stylesheets, and code you can paste into
your own application to get started quickly. This Pyramid/Pylons guide contains
material that was previously in the Akhet manual but was moved here because it
applies to a wider Pyramid context.

The examples here are from Pyramid's "alchemy" scaffold and the Akhet demo. You
may want to have these directories open in other windows as you read along.
If you haven't created a Pyramid application yet, see "Creating Your First
Pyramid Application" in the Pyramid manual.
