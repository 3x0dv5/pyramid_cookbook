This guide discusses how Pyramid differs from Pylons, and how to make it more
like Pylons. Readers coming from Django or another Rails-like framework may
also find parts of it helpful. The author has been a Pylons developer since
2007, and aims to "answer the questions Pylons users have about Pyramid". 
Earlier versions of some of these chapters were published in the Akhet_ manual,
but they have now been moved here and revised.
