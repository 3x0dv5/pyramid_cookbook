*XXX This guide is under construction. More chapters will be added in a few days.*

This guide discusses how Pyramid differs from Pylons, and how to make it more
like Pylons. It may indirectly help those familiar with Django or other
Rails-like frameworks too. It complements the Pyramid manual by explaining
things in a different way, highlighting aspects pertinent to Pylons-like
applications, and covering some things not in the manual.

See also Akhet_, a third-party library that adds some
Pylons-like features. It includes a demo application that shows them in action,
and also contains some T templates, stylesheets, and code you can paste into
your own application to get started quickly. This Pyramid/Pylons guide contains
material that was previously in the Akhet manual but was moved here because it
applies to a wider Pyramid context.
