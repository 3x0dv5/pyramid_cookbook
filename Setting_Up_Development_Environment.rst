==================================
Setting Up Development Environment
==================================

Start out by following the installation steps at http://docs.pylonshq.com/pyramid/dev/narr/install.html#installing-pyramid

This will give you a basic development environment, but it does not tell you how to install and configure an IDE.

Once you have completed the instructions at the pylonshq website, download and install the latest version of Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
